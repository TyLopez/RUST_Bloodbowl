# RUST_Bloodbowl




Bloodbowl is a Rust PVP event plug-in involving item collection, loot, and quick access for players to return to the event. It is similar in function to the Holiday events, which transforms a monument, or any specified Zone Manager zone, into a Bloodbowl. 

<h1>Features</h1>

* Blood spawns from the sky and falls into the monument zone.
  * The collectable blood is highlighted to players with a red circle.
  * Upon picking-up blood: 
    1. Players receive a digital currency which they may later redeem for rewards. 
    2. Players receive no physical item, and the blood is removed from the world.
* Rewards to top finishers of collectathon.
* Leaderboard is displayed in an attractive GUI which updates instantly.
* Configurable supply drops, chinook crates spawn to encourage participation.
* Players may push a button to air-drop upon death back into the fight with a configurable kit.
